Home Assignment 3

Deadline: 23:59, March 3, Moscow time.

Instructions:

1. Click on invatation link (in Telegram chat).
2. Log in to GitHub (if you have not registered, you need to do this) and agree to everything.
3. This will take you to your private repository named dap-2021-ha3-username. It contains a Jupyter notebook with tasks. You need to create your repository only once, then you just use it (i.e. you don't need to follow the invitation link every time).
4. The easiest option is to download the entire repository "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP".
5. You solve your homework locally (i.e. in your laptop) and write the code in the notebook. Save it with the name: HA3_Name_Surname_Group.ipynb. Only .ipynb format is acceptable.
6. When everything is ready, go to your private repository, click on the "Upload files" button and upload your file with the solutions. You can upload the solution an unlimited number of times before the deadline. However, you need to save only the last (final) version of file instead of all of them.
